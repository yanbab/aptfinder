 "description":"Lightweight X11 window manager written in Haskell",
 "details":" This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.\n See http:\/\/www.haskell.org\/ for more information on Haskell.\n\n Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in\n Haskell.  Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms,\n which can be dynamically reconfigured. At any time windows are\n arranged so as to maximise the use of screen real estate. All\n features of the window manager are accessible purely from the\n keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in\n Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user\n in config files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user\n should know in advance precisely the window arrangement that will\n result from any action.\n\n This package comes pre-configured with the default configuration. If\n you want to build your custom-configured version, make sure that\n libghc-xmonad-dev is installed and put your configuration in\n ~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs\n x11::window-manager\n",
