 "description":"Platform independent Python debugger",
 "details":" Winpdb supports debugging of threads- and curses based applications,\n namespace modification and embedded debugging. As a remote debugger,\n it uses (encrypted) network connections to connect to the debuggee\n (which is running on the same machine, usually).\n\n Winpdb is the graphical, wx-based frontend to rpdb2, which is also\n included in this package. rpdb2 is text based and able to use screen\n sessions if there is no x-terminal-emulator available.\n\n Winpdb is up to 20 times faster than pdb.\n interface::text-mode, interface::x11, role::program,\n uitoolkit::wxwidgets, x11::application\n",
