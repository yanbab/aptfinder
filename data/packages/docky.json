Docky is fully integrated into the GNOME\n Desktop and features a no nonsense approach to configuration and usage.\n It just works.\n\n Docky provides an application launcher, running application management, and\n various \"docklets\" including a CPU monitor, weather report and clock.  It is\n similar to other docks such as AWN and cairo-dock.\n\n Applications can integrate with Docky to add extra items to their context\n menus or modify their icons to display more information.  This package\n includes integration helpers for a number of applications, including Banshee,\n Rhythmbox, Deluge, Tomboy and Zeitgeist.\n\n Docky is derived from the GNOME Do \"docky\" interface.\n use::monitor\n",
