 "description":"Simple text-based mixer control program",
 "details":" aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound\n card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command\n line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it\n can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and\n boot.\n\n A wrapper script xaumix is provided that finds and invokes xterm or a\n replacement. This is primarily for creating the best sized terminal window.\n If you want a true graphical interface, install aumix-gtk instead. That has\n the same functionality as this one in addition to offering a nice X GUI.\n sound::mixer, uitoolkit::ncurses, works-with::audio\n",
