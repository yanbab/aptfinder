 "description":"Standalone graphical debugger for GNOME",
 "details":" Nemiver is a project to write a standalone graphical debugger that\n integrates in the GNOME desktop. It features a backend which uses\n the well known GNU Debugger gdb to debug C\/C++ programs.\n\n Nemiver is built with a plugin system that can offer several different\n perspectives. Currently the only perspective provided is a debugging\n perspective, but it could be expanded with perspectives added for\n valgrind, or for profiling tools such as oprofile.\n interface::x11, role::program, suite::gnome, uitoolkit::gtk,\n x11::application\n",
