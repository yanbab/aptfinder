 "details":" TeleGNOME is a program to display teletext pages over the internet. As of\n this moment, the teletext feeds from the Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark,\n Finland, Turkey, Armenia, the Czech Republic, and the United Kingdom are\n known to work.\n\n The program is kept quite simple, but it is very useful, hopefully. Never\n load up that large slow web browser to view the teletext pages, just use\n this nifty little piece of software.\n scope::utility, suite::gnome, uitoolkit::gtk, use::downloading,\n use::viewing, x11::application\n",
