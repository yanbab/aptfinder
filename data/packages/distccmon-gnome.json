 "details":" distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across\n several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same\n results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often\n significantly faster than a local compile.  distcc does not require all\n machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to have\n the same libraries or header files installed.\n\n this is the GTK+ monitor program.\n interface::x11, role::program, scope::utility, suite::gnome,\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::monitor, works-with::software:source,\n x11::application\n",
