 "details":" MComix is an user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically\n designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer.\n It reads images in ZIP, RAR, 7Zip or tar archives as well as plain image\n files. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings,\n and runs on both Linux and Windows.\n\n MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes\n and stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late\n 2009.\n",
