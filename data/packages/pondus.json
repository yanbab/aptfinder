All data can be plotted to get a quick overview of the history of\n your weight. A simple weight planner allows one to define \"target weights\"\n and this plan can be compared with the actual measurements in a plot.\n role::program, scope::utility, uitoolkit::gtk, use::monitor,\n x11::application\n",
