 "description":"GPS mapping (GeoTiff and vector) and GPSr management",
 "details":" This package provides a versatile tool for GPS maps in GeoTiff format as\n well as Garmin's img vector map format. QLandkarteGT is the successor of\n QLandkarte. Among various improvements (e.g. 2D\/3D map rendering and\n reduced resource demands) the major difference is its\n device-independent architecture, which is not limited to Garmin devices\n anymore. Therefore, the package also does not include device drivers.\n Drivers for a number of Garmin devices are available from the\n qlandkartegt-garmin package.\n\n Additionally, QLandkarteGT serves as a frontend to the GDAL tools, to\n make georeferencing of scanned maps feasible for users. In contrast to\n similar tools (e.g. QGis) its straightforward interface is especially\n suited for non-scientific users.\n uitoolkit::qt, x11::application\n",
