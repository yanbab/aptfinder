 "description":"Ear training software",
 "details":" GNU Solfege is an ear training program for X Window written in Python,\n using the GTK+ 2.0 libraries. You can practice harmonic and\n melodic intervals, chords, scales and rhythms, and you can add new\n exercises using a simple plain text file format.\n\n Ear training is a big subject with many connections to music theory\n and performance of music, so I won't even try to make \"a complete\n computer-based ear training course\". But I hope someone find this\n software useful.\n suite::gnu, uitoolkit::gtk, use::learning, x11::application\n",
