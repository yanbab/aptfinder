 "description":"Framework for source code analysis of software written in C",
 "details":" Frama-C is a framework dedicated to the analysis of the source code\n of software written in C.\n\n Frama-C gathers several static analysis techniques in a single\n collaborative framework. The collaborative approach of Frama-C allows\n static analyzers to build upon the results already computed by other\n analyzers in the framework. Thanks to this approach, Frama-C provides\n sophisticated tools, such as a slicer and dependency analysis.\n\n It can be used to:\n   * Validate the source code formally\n   * Look for potential runtime errors\n   * Audit or review it\n   * Reverse engineer it to understand its structure\n   * Generate formal documentation\n\n This package provides the graphical user interface of Frama-c and depends\n on frama-c-base.\n uitoolkit::ncurses, x11::application\n",
