 "description":"graphical player for Interactive Fiction games",
 "details":" Gargoyle is an Interactive Fiction (text adventure) player that\n supports all the major interactive fiction formats.\n\n Most interactive fiction is distributed as portable game files. These\n portable game files come in many formats. In the past, you used to\n have to download a separate player (interpreter) for each format of\n IF you wanted to play. Instead, Gargoyle provides unified player.\n\n Gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it\n supports: .taf (Adrift games, played with Scare), .dat (AdvSys),\n *.agx\/.d$$ (AGiliTy), .a3c (Alan3), .asl\/.cas (Quest games, played\n with Geas), .jacl\/.j2 (JACL), .l9\/.sna (Level 9), .mag (Magnetic),\n *.saga (Scott Adams Grand Adventures), .gam\/.t3 (TADS),\n *.z1\/.z2\/.z3\/.z4\/.z5\/.z6\/.z7\/.z8 (Inform Z-Machine games, played with\n Frotz, Nitfol or Bocfel), .ulx\/.blb\/.blorb\/.glb\/.gblorb (Inform or\n Supergl\u00fas games compiled to the Glulxe VM in Blorb archives, played\n with Git or Glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (Inform Z-Machine games in Blorb\n archives, played with Frotz).\n\n (note: do not confuse the Git Glux interpreter with the Git DVCS or\n the GNU Interactive Tools)\n\n Gargoyle also features graphics, sounds and Unicode support.\n\n Technically all the bundled interpreters support the Glk API to\n manage I\/O (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in IF games. Gargoyle\n provides a Glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and\n images in a graphical Gtk window, with care on typography.\n\n Limitations:\n\n * This free version of gargoyle does not include the non-free Alan2\n and Hugo interpreter (and use a different, free monospace font).\n\n * While Gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a\n way to display the cover art present in some Blorb archives.\n\n * The TADS interpreter doesn't support HTML TADS; you can play\n the games, but will miss the hyperlinks.\n",
