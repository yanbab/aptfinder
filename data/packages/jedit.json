 "description":"Plugin-based editor for programmers",
 "details":" As one of the most feature rich editors available, jEdit boasts support for\n syntax highlighting in more than 140 languages. jEdit combines the power of\n Emacs, the user-friendliness of Kate, and the advanced editing features\n (such as vertical paste) of Ultraedit, to bring you an open-source\n plugin-based programmer's editor of professional quality.\n\n It is possible to define complex macros in BeanShell or Jython, or other\n languages that fit into the BSF. jEdit offers a powerful and user-friendly\n keyboard mapping system (including 2-keystroke shortcuts), making it\n possible to give jEdit a very Emacs-like feel, if you so desire.\n\n Its functionality is easily extended by the use of 'plugins' which can be\n downloaded, updated, and installed, all without exiting the editor. These\n include a built-in Console shell integration, which lets you execute\n interactive external commands inside your editor, as well as bind them to\n keyboard shortcuts. The FTP plugin lets you browse and edit files on remote\n systems over FTP or SFTP. Other plugins provide shells, object oriented\n structure\/code browsers, or completion popups for Java, XML, HTML, Ant,\n LaTeX, Python, Ruby, Perl, C, C++, bash, Scheme, Prolog, and many other\n languages.\n",
