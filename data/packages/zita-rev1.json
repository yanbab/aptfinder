 "details":" REV1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for Aeolus.\n Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used on a wide\n variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser - the early\n reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not correspond\n to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and right sources to\n some extent.\n\n In Stereo mode a dry\/wet mix control is provided, so it can be used either\n as an insert or in send\/return mode. For mono just connect one of the\n two channels.\n\n In Ambisonic mode (selected by the -B command line option) the only option\n is the send\/return mode.\n",
