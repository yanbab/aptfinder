 "details":" Guido van Robot Next Generation (GvRng) is a project developed by advanced\n high school students for use by their peers as a learning tool and precursor\n to the further study of programming with Python. It is a minimalistic\n programming language providing just enough syntax to help students learn the\n concepts of sequencing, conditional branching, looping and procedural\n abstraction.\n\n It's biggest strength is that it permits this learning in an environment that\n combines the thrill of problem-solving with instant visual feedback. In\n short, it is an interactive, introductory programming language that is\n excellent for learning the basic concepts of programming, applicable in any\n high-level language.\n\n The GvRng version replaces the old GvR program that used wxPython for the\n GUI.\n interface::x11, role::program, uitoolkit::gtk, use::gameplaying,\n use::learning, x11::application\n",
