 "details":" JClic is formed by a set of computer applications that are used for\n carrying out different types of educational activities: puzzles,\n associations, text exercises, crosswords...\n\n The activities are not usually used alone, but packed in projects. A\n project is formed by a set of activities and one or more sequences,\n which indicate the order in which they have to be shown.\n\n Its community (http:\/\/clic.xtec.net\/db\/listact_en.jsp) has developed a web\n site with more than 1.000 activities available in several languages.\n\n This package contains JClic-author to create and modify activity\n projects, JClic standalone player to play the activities and\n JClic-reports that allows the management of a database to track\n students work and results.\n",
