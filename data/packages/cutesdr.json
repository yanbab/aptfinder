 "description":"simple demodulation and spectrum display program",
 "details":" The CuteSDR application's primary purpose is for spawning custom\n applications or for educational use. It is NOT a full featured\n program as it is purposely kept simple in order for developers to\n more easily spin off their own applications. A further goal was to\n use only the stock functionality of Qt ie no libraries or special\n drivers. This limits CuteSDR to using only a network connection.\n The main gui and framework is written by Moe Wheatly, AE4JY.\n\n CuteSDR itself has only a network interface and will directly support\n the RFSPACE NetSDR and SDR-IP radios. This package also supports\n SDR-IQ\/14 using an included network protocol server application (siqs_ftdi)\n by Andrea Montefusco, IW0HDV with support from Ken Hopper, N9VV.\n",
