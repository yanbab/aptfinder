 "description":"printer driver for ZjStream-based printers",
 "details":" foo2zjs is an open source printer driver for printers that use the\n Zenographics ZjStream wire protocol for their print data, such as the\n Minolta magicolor 2200\/2300\/2430 DL, Minolta Color PageWorks\/Pro L and\n HP LaserJet 1000\/1005\/1018\/1020\/1022. These printers are often\n erroneously referred to as \"winprinters\" or \"GDI printers\".\n\n This package provides the following drivers: foo2hiperc, foo2hp,\n foo2lava, foo2oak, foo2qpdl, foo2slx, foo2xqx, foo2zjs.\n\n The foomatic-db-engine package is recommended to simplify configuring\n this printer driver.  The psutils package is needed to enable n-up\n printing support.\n",
