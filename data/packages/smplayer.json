 "description":"complete front-end for MPlayer and MPlayer2",
 "details":" Qt4 Mplayer front-end, with basic features like playing\n videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features like support\n for MPlayer filters and more. One of the most interesting features\n of SMPlayer: it remembers the settings of all files you play.\n So you start to watch a movie but you have to leave... don't\n worry, when you open that movie again it will resume at the same\n point you left it, and with the same settings: audio track,\n subtitles, volume...\n works-with::audio, works-with::video, x11::application\n",
