 "details":" Xpra gives you the functionality of GNU Screen for X applications.\n\n It allows the user to view remote X applications on their local machine, and\n disconnect and reconnect from the remote machine without losing the state of\n the running applications.\n\n Unlike VNC, these applications are \"rootless\".  They appear as individual\n windows inside your window manager rather than being contained within a single\n window.\n",
