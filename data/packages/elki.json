 "details":" ELKI: \"Environment for Developing KDD-Applications Supported by\n Index-Structures\" is a development framework for data mining algorithms\n written in Java.  It includes a large variety of popular data mining\n algorithms, distance functions and index structures.\n\n Its focus is particularly on clustering and outlier detection methods, in\n contrast to many other data mining toolkits that focus on classification.\n Additionally, it includes support for index structures to improve algorithm\n performance such as R*-Tree and M-Tree.\n\n The modular architecture is meant to allow adding custom components such\n as distance functions or algorithms, while being able to reuse the other\n parts for evaluation.\n\n This package also includes the source code, since this software is meant\n for the rapid development of such algorithms, not so much for end users.\n implemented-in::java, interface::commandline, interface::x11,\n role::devel-lib, role::program, role::source, science::calculation,\n science::visualisation, scope::utility, uitoolkit::gtk, use::analysing,\n works-with-format::TODO, works-with-format::svg, works-with::db,\n x11::application\n",
