 "description":"distributed IRC client - Qt-based monolithic core+client",
 "details":" Quassel is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that\n one or more clients can attach to and detach from the central core. It's\n much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client\n such as WeeChat or irssi, but graphical.\n\n This package provides the monolithic client. It contains both core and\n client and can be used like a traditional IRC client, without requiring an\n external core.\n uitoolkit::qt, use::chatting, x11::application\n",
