 "details":" streamtuner2 is a browser for radio station directories. It can fetch lists\n from SHOUTcast, Xiph.org, Live365, Jamendo, DMOZ, basic.ch, Punkcast.\n And it lists stream entries by category or genre. It reuses existing audio\n players, and recording is delegated to streamripper.\n\n It mimics the original streamtuner 0.99.99, but is easier to extend because\n it's written entirely in Python. It's already in a stable and useable form.\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::browsing, use::playing, works-with::audio,\n x11::application\n",
