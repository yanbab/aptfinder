 "description":"powerful tool for visualizing 3-dimensional data sets",
 "details":" IFRIT (the Ionization FRont Interactive Tool) has its origins (and\n hence name) in a specialized utility designed to visualize ionization\n fronts in cosmological numerical simulations.  IFRIT, however, has\n outgrown its origins and now can visualize general data sets as well.\n\n IFRIT is written in C++ and is based on two state-of-the-art toolkits:\n the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) and a GUI toolkit QT.\n uitoolkit::ncurses, uitoolkit::qt, use::viewing, x11::application\n",
