 "details":" The PCP GUI package primarily includes visualisation tools for\n monitoring systems using live and archived Performance Co-Pilot\n (PCP) sources.\n\n These tools have dependencies on graphics libraries which may or\n may not be installed on server machines, so PCP GUI is delivered,\n managed and maintained as a separate (source and binary) package\n to the core PCP infrastructure.\n",
