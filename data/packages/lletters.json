 "description":"GTK letters-learning game for small children",
 "details":" This is based on author's daughter's (formerly) favorite game, Larry's\n Learning Letters and Numbers. This is a Linux replacement, written from\n scratch, with many improvements.  It was built using the GTK (Gimp\n ToolKit) for X.  It presently works with 1.0.x and 1.1.x, but images\n load faster with the newer library.\n\n It is intended for children 2 and up, and is a fun learning game.  It\n helps younger children learn their letters and numbers, while older\n children will improve their spelling, and vocabulary skills.  It also\n helps them develop important keyboard and mouse skills too.\n\n You can have more than one image for each word, more than one word for each\n letter, and you can add new images without recompiling too.\n use::gameplaying, use::learning, x11::application\n",
