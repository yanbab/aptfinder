 "description":"GNOME front-end for backintime",
 "details":" Back In Time is a framework for rsync, diff and cron for the purpose of\n taking snapshots and backups of specified folders. It minimizes disk space use\n by taking a snapshot only if the directory has been changed, and hard links\n for unmodified files if it has. The user can schedule regular backups using\n cron.\n\n This is the GNOME front-end for the backintime-common package. If you also\n install the package nautilus-actions, it can be integrated with the Nautilus\n file manager to provide context-menu options.\n uitoolkit::gtk, works-with::file\n",
