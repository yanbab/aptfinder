 "details":" Tired of scores indicating things destroyed or lives snuffed? Try something\n different -- fly a helicopter around and rescue people in distress. If you\n were in trouble wouldn't you want someone to rescue you?\n\n This game is intended for players of all audiences, but especially for mature\n players who want to get away from the violence and still retain a level of\n precise challenge. Flight difficulty can be lowered for beginners (regardless\n of mission type), and graphics minimized to suit slower computers\n (minimum Pentium 166 with no graphics acceleration).\n hardware::input:keyboard, interface::3d, interface::x11, role::program,\n uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
