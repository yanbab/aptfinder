GUI support is provided for over a dozen\n operations, including add files, commit changes, manage ignore filter, view\n change log, merge, recover\/rollback, edit configuration, synchronize\n repository, and many others.   The highlight is the interactive commit tool\n which allows easy selection of diffs from multiple files and packaging into\n changesets, and which is more powerful and easier to use than available\n alternatives such as qct and hgct (commit-tool).\n scope::application, uitoolkit::gtk, use::synchronizing, use::viewing,\n works-with::vcs, x11::application\n",
