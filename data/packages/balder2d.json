 "description":"A 2D shooter in zero gravity",
 "details":" In Balder2D, players control small probes which shoot tiny projectiles with\n which they try to destroy each other. It features a 2D overhead view of the\n playing field. Probes may be human or computer controlled.\n\n A probe can perform the following actions:\n\n    * rotate\n    * fire projectiles\n    * \"stick\" to a wall\n    * push off of a wall\n\n Players may rotate their probes while in flight, but the only way to change\n the direction or speed of flight is by firing projectiles (which gives a\n small kick in the opposite direction) or by running into walls or other probes.\n",
