 "details":" XScavenger is a platform game for the X Window System. From the README:\n\n Scavenger is like Lode Runner. You've got to run around gathering objects\n while avoiding enemies. You can dig down through some of the blocks to get\n at buried objects. After you've collected everything, ladders may appear.\n To finish the level you've got to exit through the top of the screen. If\n an enemy falls into a dug brick, he is stunned for a while. If the brick\n fills in with him in it, he is killed, and he will reappear at the top of\n the screen.\n\n This version has a level editor for designing your own levels, and a\n graphics editor for drawing your own artwork.\n role::program, uitoolkit::xlib, use::editing, use::gameplaying,\n x11::application\n",
