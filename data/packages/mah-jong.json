 "description":"Original Mah-Jong game",
 "details":" This is a set of programs to play the original Mah-Jong game: one\n server, one client for a human player and one client for an AI\n player. Hence the game can be played by 1 to 4 human players.\n\n You should keep in mind that the original Mah-Jong game has nothing\n to do with the well-known solitaire game. (It merely uses the same\n set of tiles.)\n\n If you like the game, please consider making a donation to the\n (upstream) author. Read \/usr\/share\/doc\/mah-jong\/README.Debian for\n details.\n use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
