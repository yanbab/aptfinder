 "details":" Cadabra is a computer algebra system designed specifically for the\n solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive\n functionality for tensor polynomial simplification including\n multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables,\n Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate\n dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input format is\n a subset of TeX.\n",
