 "description":"ncurses-based client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)",
 "details":" ncmpcpp is almost an exact clone of ncmpc which is a text-mode client\n for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. It provides a keyboard oriented and\n consistent interface to MPD and contains some new features ncmpc\n doesn't have. It's been also rewritten from scratch in C++.\n\n New features include:\n  - tag editor;\n  - playlists editor;\n  - easy to use search screen;\n  - media library screen;\n  - lyrics screen;\n  - possibility of going to any position in currently playing track\n    without rewinding\/fastforwarding;\n  - multi colored main window (if you want);\n  - songs can be added to playlist more than once;\n  - a lot of minor useful functions.\n",
