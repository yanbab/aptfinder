 "details":" massXpert is a program to simulate and analyse mass spectrometric\n data obtained on linear (bio-)polymers. It is the successor of GNU\n polyxmass.\n\n Four modules allow:\n  - making brand new polymer chemistry definitions;\n  - using the definitions to perform easy calculations in a desktop\n    calculator-like manner;\n  - performing sophisticated polymer sequence editing and simulations;\n  - perform m\/z list comparisons;\n\n Chemical simulations encompass cleavage (either chemical or\n enzymatic), gas-phase fragmentations, chemical modification of any\n monomer in the polymer sequence, cross-linking of monomers in the\n sequence, arbitrary mass searches, calculation of the isotopic\n pattern...\n field::chemistry, implemented-in::c++, interface::x11, role::program,\n uitoolkit::qt, use::analysing, use::simulating, works-with-format::xml,\n works-with::biological-sequence, x11::application\n",
