 "details":" SFLphone is a SIP\/IAX2 compatible softphone for Linux. The SFLphone project's\n goal is to create a robust enterprise-class desktop phone. While it can serve\n home users very well, it is designed with a hundred-calls-a-day receptionist\n in mind.\n\n It features a flexible client\/server architecture where the GTK+ client talks\n to the daemon through DBus and is capable of handling multiple VoIP connections\n at once.\n\n This is the graphical client for GNOME.\n x11::application\n",
