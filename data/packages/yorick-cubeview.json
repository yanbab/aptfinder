 "description":"3D FITS data viewer specialized in spectro-imaging",
 "details":" Cubeview is a viewer for 3D data store in FITS files, a file format\n extensively used among astronomers. It is specialized in displaying\n spectro-imaging data but can be used to do basic visualization on any\n FITS file containing a 3D array.\n\n Cubeview features a stand-alone graphical user interface which\n adheres to the GTK+ look-and-feel. Being written (mostly) in\n Yorick, it is inherently scriptable. A system of hooks allows custom\n actions to be repeated automatically when certain events occur.\n interface::shell, interface::x11, role::plugin, role::program,\n scope::utility, suite::TODO, uitoolkit::gtk, use::viewing,\n works-with-format::TODO, works-with::image, works-with::image:raster,\n x11::application\n",
