 "details":" Hatari is an emulator for the Atari ST line of computers.\n\n The Atari ST was a 16\/32 bit computer system which was first released by\n Atari in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer\n having quite a lot of CPU power at that time.\n\n Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment\n for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as\n close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games and\n demos.\n uitoolkit::sdl, x11::application\n",
