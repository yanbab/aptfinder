 "description":"light download accelerator - graphical front-end",
 "details":" Axel tries to accelerate the downloading process by using multiple connections\n for one file.  It can also use multiple mirrors for one download.  Axel tries\n to be as light as possible (25-30k in binary form), so it might be useful as a\n wget clone on byte-critical systems.\n\n This package provides a QT based graphical front-end as a wrapper around Axel.\n suite::kde, uitoolkit::qt, use::downloading, x11::application\n",
