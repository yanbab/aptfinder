 "details":" GNUnet is a peer-to-peer framework which focuses on providing security. All\n link-to-link messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. The\n framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate\n the peer-to-peer traffic in UDP, TCP, or SMTP messages.\n\n This package contains the graphical client, using the GTK+ toolkit. In order\n use GNUnet, you also need gnunet-server either on your server or on your local\n machine.\n scope::application, security::authentication, suite::gnu,\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::chatting, use::downloading, x11::application\n",
