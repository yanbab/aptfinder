 "description":"KDE version of the Simon electronic memory game",
 "details":" Blinken is based on an electronic game released in 1978, which\n challenges players to remember sequences of increasing length.  On\n the face of the device, there are 4 different color buttons, each\n with its own distinctive sound.  These buttons light up randomly,\n creating the sequence that the player must then recall.  If the\n player is successful in remembering the sequence of lights in the\n correct order, they advance to the next stage, where an identical\n sequence with one extra step is presented.\n\n This package is part of the KDE education module.\n suite::kde, uitoolkit::qt, use::gameplaying, use::learning,\n x11::application\n",
