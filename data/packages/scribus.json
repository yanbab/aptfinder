 "details":" Scribus is an open source desktop page layout program with the aim of\n producing commercial grade output in PDF and Postscript, primarily, though\n not exclusively for Linux.\n\n Scribus can be used for many tasks; from brochure design to newspapers,\n magazines, newsletters and posters to technical documentation. It has\n sophisticated page layout features like precision placing and rotating of text\n and\/or images on a page, manual kerning of type, bezier curves polygons,\n precision placement of objects, layering with RGB and CMYK custom colors.

Graphic formats which can be placed in Scribus as images\n include PDF, Encapsulated Post Script (eps), TIFF, JPEG, PNG and XPixMap(xpm),\n and any bitmap type supported by QT4.\n\n Printing, PDF and SVG creation are done via custom driver libraries and\n plug-ins, giving Scribus inventive features: the abilities to include\n presentation effects with PDF output, fully scriptable interactive PDF\n forms, SVG vector file output.
