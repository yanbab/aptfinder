 "description":"reduce 3D shapes to a single square",
 "details":" Phlipple is a unique puzzle game. The goal of every level is to reduce\n a 3D shape to a single square. Elimination of squares is done by flipping\n edges around just like in a cardboard box. It starts off relatively easy\n to teach the basics just to later on serve hours of brain tickling fun.\n It's a great way to train memory as well as orientation in 3D.\n uitoolkit::glut, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
