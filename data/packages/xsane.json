 "details":" xsane can be run as a stand-alone program or through the GIMP image\n manipulation program.  In stand-alone mode, xsane can save an image\n to a file in a variety of image formats, serve as a frontend to a\n fax program, or send an image to a printer.\n\n SANE stands for \"Scanner Access Now Easy\" and is an application\n programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any\n raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,\n video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is\n free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The\n current source code is written to support several operating systems,\n including GNU\/Linux, OS\/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available\n under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and\n backends are welcome, too, however).\n works-with::image, works-with::image:raster, x11::application\n",
