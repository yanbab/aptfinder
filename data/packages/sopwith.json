 "details":" This is an updated version of the 1980's game developed by David L. Clark of\n BMB Compuscience Canada.  It has been adapted to run under *nix using the SDL\n toolkit. Poor graphics, stupid AI, and horrible sound await you. The gameplay\n is simple, addictive, and fun. A `side-scroller', you pilot your biplane\n across a static field, destroying enemy encampments and planes.\n uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
