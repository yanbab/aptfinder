 "description":"Displays time and date in specified time zones",
 "details":" This program displays the time and date of specified time zones using a\n GTK+ interface. It also provides a \"rendezvous\" function allowing the zones\n to be synchronised to a time other than the current time. This can help you\n organise meetings across different timezones.\n\n The time zones may be entered by hand in TZ format or chosen from a list\n prepared from \/usr\/share\/zoneinfo\/zone.tab.  The zone list is kept in a format\n consistent with the shell script tzwatch.\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::timekeeping, works-with::pim, x11::application\n",
