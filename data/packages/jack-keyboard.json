 "description":"Virtual MIDI keyboard for JACK MIDI",
 "details":" JACK keyboard is a program that allows you to send JACK MIDI\n events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard. It's somewhat similar to\n vkeybd, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the default\n keyboard mapping is much better - it uses the same layout as\n trackers (like Impulse Tracker) did, so you have two and half\n octaves under your fingers.\n",
