 "details":" The Password Gorilla helps you manage your logins. It stores all your\n user names and passwords, along with login information and other\n notes, in a securely encrypted file. A single \"master password\" is\n used to protect the file. This way, you only need to remember the\n single master password, instead of the many logins that you use.\n\n If you want to log in to a service or Web site, the Password Gorilla\n copies your user name and password to the clipboard, so that you can\n easily paste it into your Web browser or other application. Because\n the password does not appear on the screen, Password Gorilla is safe\n to use in the presence of others.\n\n The convenience of Password Gorilla allows you to choose different,\n non-intuitive passwords for each service. An integrated random\n password generator can provide one-time passwords, tunable to various\n services' policies.\n\n Password Gorilla is a tcl\/tk application which can run on Linux and\n Windows, and the files written are supposed to be compatible between\n platforms. This is important for collaboration in heterogenous\n environments.\n",
