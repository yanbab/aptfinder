 "description":"JACK autotuner",
 "details":" AT1 is an 'autotuner', normally used to correct the pitch of a voice\n singing (slightly) out of tune. Compared to 'Autotalent' it provides\n an improved pitch estimation algorithm, and much cleaner resampling.\n\n AT1 does not include formant correction, so it should be used to\n correct small errors only and not to really transpose a song. The\n 'expected' pitch can be controlled by Midi (via Jack only), or be a\n fixed set of notes. AT1 can probably be used on some instruments as\n well, but is primarily designed to cover the vocal range. It's also\n usable as a quick and dirty guitar tuner.\n",
