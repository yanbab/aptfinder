 "details":" Back In Time is a framework for rsync, diff and cron for the purpose of\n taking snapshots and backups of specified folders. It minimizes disk space use\n by taking a snapshot only if the directory has been changed, and hard links\n for unmodified files if it has. The user can schedule regular backups using\n cron.\n\n This is the KDE front-end for the backintime-common package.\n interface::x11, role::program, uitoolkit::qt, works-with::file\n",
