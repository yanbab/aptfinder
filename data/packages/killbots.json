 "description":"port of the classic BSD console game robots",
 "details":" killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. The robots are numerous\n and their sole objective is to destroy you.  Fortunately for you, their\n creator has focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result\n the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. Your superior wit and\n a fancy teleportation device are your only weapons against the never-ending\n stream of mindless automatons.\n\n This package is part of the KDE games module.\n suite::kde, uitoolkit::qt, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
