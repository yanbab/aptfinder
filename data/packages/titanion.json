 "details":" Titanion is an abstract shooter game. While we fire with one button, the\n other one acts as a tractor ray to attract the enemies and take them to\n the combat line. The game in itself is quite simple, but with such\n graphics and playability that it's worth a try.\n\n Titanion is another gem among many by Kenta Cho.\n role::program, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
