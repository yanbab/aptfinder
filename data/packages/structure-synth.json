 "details":" Structure Synth is a tool for generating 3D structures by specifying a\n design grammar. Even simple systems may generate surprising and complex\n structures. Structure Synth offers a graphical environment with multiple\n tabs, syntax highlighting, and OpenGL preview. Integration with third-party\n renderers (such as Sunflow and POV-Ray) is possible using a flexible\n template based export system.\n\n Structure Synth has been developed by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. It was\n inspired by the CFDG syntax by Chris Coyne, and the Context Free Art GUI by\n Mark Lentczner and John Horigan.\n works-with::3dmodel, x11::application\n",
