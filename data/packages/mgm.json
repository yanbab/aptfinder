 "description":"A highly configurable, very gaudy system load meter",
 "details":" MGM is the Moaning Goat Meter, a system load monitor along the lines\n of procmeter3 but much prettier (and with a much higher resource usage).\n It's written in Perl\/Tk, uses a nice antialiased Helvetica font, is\n configurable with X resources, and can have a larger memory footprint than\n Emacs.\n scope::application, uitoolkit::tk, use::monitor, x11::application\n",
