 "details":" Spydr (pronounced like spider) basically is an FITS image viewer. It\n can work as a stand-alone application but is best integrated in a\n Yorick-based data-analysis work-flow (Yorick is an interpreted\n language specialized in numerical computations and scientific\n graphics). It includes tools to zoom, produce cuts, histograms,\n Gaussian\/Moffat fits, PSF fits (inc. FWHM and Strehl). Can work on\n single images, sequences of images or data cubes.\n",
