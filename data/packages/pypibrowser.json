 "details":" PyPI Browser is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for browsing the\n contents of the Python Package Index (PyPI). It queries the online\n Package Index server to retrieve information about the available\n packages.\n\n It aims to make it easier for users to find and download useful Python\n software from a central repository. It provides facilities for searching\n the package index, can display information about individual packages,\n allows packages to be marked so that they can be downloaded together, and\n records information about existing packages so that new ones can be\n highlighted.\n\n Be warned that the preferred way of installing Python modules in the\n Debian distribution is from the official python-* packages.\n",
