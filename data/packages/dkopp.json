 "description":"Full and incremental backup to DVD",
 "details":" Dkopp is a program used to copy or back-up disk files to DVD or\n BD (Blue-ray) media. Full or incremental backups can be done,\n with full or incremental media verification. A GUI is used to\n navigate through directories to select or de-select files or\n directories at any level. Backup jobs can be saved for later re-use.\n New, deleted, and updated disk files are handled automatically,\n without re-editing the backup job. An incremental backup updates\n the same DVD\/BD media used for a prior full backup. Files can be\n restored to the same or another location on disk. Large backup\n jobs can be done using multiple DVD media.\n",
