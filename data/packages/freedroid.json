 "description":"Clone of Paradroid - a strategic shoot-em up",
 "details":" You must clear a spaceship from all droids.  To achieve this your\n device will need to take control of more powerful droids, more able\n to confront the most powerful ones.  But you'll also need to manage\n your energy, as you won't be able to control any droid for an\n indefinite time, and even your own device has a limited lifetime.\n\n Note that this package is different from the freedroidrpg game,\n developed by the same team, and also available in Debian.\n use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
