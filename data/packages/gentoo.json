 "description":"fully GUI-configurable, two-pane X file manager",
 "details":" gentoo is a two-pane file manager for the X Window System. gentoo lets the\n user do (almost) all of the configuration and customizing from within the\n program itself. If you still prefer to hand-edit configuration files,\n they're fairly easy to work with since they are written in an XML format.\n\n gentoo features a fairly complex and powerful file identification system,\n coupled to an object-oriented style system, which together give you a lot\n of control over how files of different types are displayed and acted upon.\n Additionally, over a hundred pixmap images are available for use in file\n type descriptions.\n\n gentoo was written from scratch in ANSI C, and it utilizes the GTK+ toolkit\n for its interface.\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::browsing, use::organizing, works-with::file,\n x11::application\n",
