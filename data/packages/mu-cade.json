 "details":" Mu-cade is another shoot-em-up game by Kenta Cho. In this game Kenta has\n introduced physics into his formula of hardcore shooting games. Similar\n in some ways to Asteroids and Nibbles, the playing area is a rectangular\n arena in which vessel-snakes have only one idea at the head: expelling\n the others into the vacuum. You incarnate one of them, and you'll quickly\n realize the subtlety of the goal: your tail lengthens as you destroy your\n enemies.\n role::program, uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
