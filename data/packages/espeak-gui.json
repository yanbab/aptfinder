 "details":" eSpeak is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other\n languages.\n\n eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis\n method from other open source text to speech (TTS) engines, and sounds quite\n different. It's perhaps not as natural or \"smooth\", but some find the\n articulation clearer and easier to listen to for long periods.\n\n This package provides a graphical user interface for using eSpeak.\n",
