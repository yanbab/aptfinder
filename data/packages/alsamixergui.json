 "details":" alsamixergui is an FLTK based mixer program for use with the ALSA soundcard\n drivers. It supports multiple soundcards with multiple devices.\n\n alsamixergui is a frontend for alsamixer, written directly on top of the\n alsamixer source, leaving the original source intact, only adding a couple of\n ifdefs, and some calls to the gui part. It provides exactly the same\n functionality, but with a graphical user interface.\n\n Homepage: http:\/\/www.iua.upf.es\/~mdeboer\/projects\/alsamixergui\/\n role::program, scope::application, sound::mixer, uitoolkit::fltk,\n works-with::audio, x11::application\n",
