 "description":"ALSA GUI control tool for Envy24 (ice1712) soundcards",
 "details":" Mudita24 is a modification of the Linux alsa-tools' envy24control: an\n application controlling the digital mixer, channel gains and other hardware\n settings for sound cards based on the VIA Ice1712 chipset aka Envy24. Unlike\n most ALSA mixer controls, this application displays a level meter for each\n input and output channel and maintains peak level indicators. This is based\n on Envy24's hardware peak metering feature.\n\n Mudita24 provides alternate name to avoid confusion with \"envy24control\n 0.6.0\" until changes in this version propagate upstream. As balance to the\n \"Envy\", this project needed some Mudita \"In Buddhism the third of the four\n divine abidings is mudita, taking joy in the good fortune of another. This\n virtue is considered the antidote to envy and the opposite of\n schadenfreude.\"\n\n This utility is preferable to alsamixer for those with ice1712-based\n cards: M-Audio Delta 1010, Delta 1010LT, Delta DiO 2496, Delta 66, Delta 44,\n Delta 410 and Audiophile 2496.
