XBMC is available for Linux, Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger and Apple TV)\n and Microsoft Windows, as well as the original Xbox game console.

More than 50 software\n developers have contributed to XBMC, and 100-plus translators have worked to\n expand its reach, making it available in more than 30 languages.\n\n While XBMC functions very well as a standard media player application for\n your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your\n HTPC. Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls, and combined\n with its beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine, XBMC feels very\n natural to use from the couch and is the ideal solution for your home\n theater.
