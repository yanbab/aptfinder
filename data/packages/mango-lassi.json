 "details":" Mango-lassi lets you to share mouse and pointer with other computers using\n Avahi. It has features like:\n  * Fully peer-to-peer. All Mango Lassi instances are both client and server\n    at the same time. Other hosts may enter or leave a running session at any\n    time.\n  * No need to open X11 up for the network.\n  * You have a 50% chance that for your setup you don't need any configuration\n    at all. In the case of the other 50% you might need to swap the order of\n    your screens manually in a simple dialog, because Mango Lassi didn't guess\n    correctly which screen is left and which screen is right.\n  * libnotify integration so that it tells you whenever a desktop joins or\n    leaves your session.\n  * Shows a nice OSD on your screen when your screen's input is currently being\n    redirected to another screen.\n  * Uses all those nifty GNOME APIs, like D-Bus-over-TCP, Avahi, libnotify,\n    Gtk,..\n  * Supports both the X11 clipboard and the selection, supporting all content\n    types, and not just simple text -- i.e. you can copy and paste image data\n    between Gimp on your screens.\n",
