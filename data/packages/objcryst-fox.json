 "details":" FOX is a program for the ab initio structure determination from powder\n diffraction (neutrons, X-Ray). The crystal structure can be described as any\n combination of atoms, molecules or polyhedras, without a priori information\n about the connectivity of these 'building block'. Fox can make multi-pattern\n global optimizations, and automatically correct special positions.\n\n FOX could also be used for educational purposes, to display Crystal\n Structures in 3D with the associated powder diffraction pattern.\n",
