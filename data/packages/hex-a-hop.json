 "details":" Hex-a-hop is a great puzzle game in which a girl has to break all the green\n tiles in an hexagonal map without getting trapped. There is no time limit and\n no real-time element.\n\n The objective is simply to destroy all the green hexagonal tiles on each of\n the 100 levels. As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are\n introduced which make things more difficult and interesting.\n uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
