 "details":" Piano Booster is a new way to learn the piano just by playing a game.\n It takes elements of the game Guitar Hero but now it uses a real piano\n keyboard and the game has been turned sideways so the notes scroll along\n a musical stave. So instead of pressing buttons on a fake guitar you end\n up learning to play a real musical instrument: the piano.\n\n To run Piano Booster you need a MIDI Piano Keyboard and a MIDI interface\n for the PC. If you don't have a MIDI keyboard you can still try out\n PianoBooster, using the PC keyboard ('x' is middle C), but a MIDI piano\n is really recommended).\n use::gameplaying, works-with::music-notation, x11::application\n",
