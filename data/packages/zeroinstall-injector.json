 "details":" Zero Install is a decentralised cross-distribution software installation\n system available under the LGPL. It allows software developers to publish\n programs directly from their own web-sites, while supporting features familiar\n from centralised distribution repositories such as shared libraries, automatic\n updates and digital signatures. It is intended to complement, rather than\n replace, the operating system's package management. 0install packages never\n interfere with those provided by the distribution.\n",
