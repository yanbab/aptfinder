 "details":" So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have\n been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they\n are essential to a secret plot for world domination.\n\n In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small\n chunks. (They're afraid of water, for no apparent reason. Ah well. \"The\n Matrix\" had more plot holes than this, and it still was a hit.) You do\n this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.\n\n Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small\n enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than\n that, you'll save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek\n Cred (a.k.a. \"score\").\n\n See also http:\/\/www.mattdm.org\/icebreaker\/\n use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
