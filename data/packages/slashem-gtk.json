 "details":" Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic (SLASH'EM)\n is a role-playing game where you control a single character. The\n interface and gameplay are similar in style to Rogue, ADOM, Angband\n and, of course, Nethack. You control the actions through the\n keyboard and view the world from an overhead perspective.\n\n The problem: The Amulet of Yendor has been stolen. Not only\n that but it appears that the Wizard of Yendor (not a nice person),\n who took the amulet, is hiding in the Dungeons of Doom (not a\n friendly place).\n\n This package provides the Gtk window port of Slash'EM\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
