 "description":"flexible build script for package collections",
 "details":" Jhbuild is a program that can be used to pull a number of modules from\n Git, CVS, Subversion, Bazaar and other types of repositories or from\n tarballs and build them in the correct order.  Unlike some build\n scripts, jhbuild lets you specify what modules you want built and it\n will then go and build those modules plus dependencies.\n\n Although jhbuild was originally developed to build GNOME, it has\n since been extended to work with other projects as well.\n Extending it to handle new modules is usually trivial assuming the\n build infrastructure matches the other modules it handles.\n",
