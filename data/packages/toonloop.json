 "details":" Toonloop is a live stop-motion animation editor and player. It aims to\n show the creation process to the audience as well as the result of\n the creation. Frame by frame animations are made by adding frames\n one by one to a clip made of many frames. Clips are displayed in a\n never ending loop.\n\n Toonloop can be controlled using MIDI input, or the Open Sound Control\n protocol. (OSC) Images are saved to the disk in the JPEG format, and\n the clips are saved to movie files.\n",
