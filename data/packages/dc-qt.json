 "details":" dc-qt is a qt front-end for the dctc program. dctc handles all\n communication with dc hubs and clients, while dc-qt presents an\n interface that has many of the features of the original directconnect\n client, plus some really useful improvements.\n\n It is intended for peer-based file-sharing. In practise it works better than\n gnutella and other similar systems as it allows dc hubs (servers)\n administators to require clients to share specified amount of data. The\n amount is usually based on type of client's connection and it is used not\n to hurt or exclude anybody but to make file sharing \"fair play\".\n\n dc-qt is still alpha, so some care has to be taken - try it out!\n",
