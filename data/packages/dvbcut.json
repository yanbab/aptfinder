 "description":"Qt application for cutting parts out of DVB streams",
 "details":" DVBcut is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of an\n MPEG transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting, DVB) and\n save these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a `keyhole\n surgery'' approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept\n unchanged, and only very few frames at the beginning and\/or end of the\n selected range are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.\n x11::application\n",
