 "description":"semi-automatic segmentation of structures in 3D images",
 "details":" SNAP provides semi-automatic segmentation of structures in medical\n images (e.g.  magnetic resonance images of the brain) using active\n contour methods, as well as manual delineation and image navigation.\n Noteworthy features are:\n\n  * Linked cursor for seamless 3D navigation\n  * Manual segmentation in three orthogonal planes at once\n  * Support for many different 3D image formats, including NIfTI\n  * Support for concurrent, linked viewing and segmentation of multiple images\n  * Limited support for color images (e.g., diffusion tensor maps)\n  * 3D cut-plane tool for fast post-processing of segmentation results\n",
