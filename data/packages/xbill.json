The little people running\n around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM],\n a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  Your\n objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.\n If one of the people reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your\n operating system with the virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off\n the screen with your vital software.\n uitoolkit::athena, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
