 "description":"GNOME Shell extension providing a countdown timer in the top panel",
 "details":" Installing this package adds a timer application to the GNOME Shell top panel.\n With it you can start a timer of any duration and when elapsed, you'll get a\n notification. You can also preconfigure various durations to avoid having\n to retype them.\n\n It's a natural replacement of the \"timer applet\" for GNOME 2 (or 3 in\n fallback mode).\n\n Users of the Pomodoro method will find this extension very useful.\n",
