 "details":" Cultivation is a game about a community of gardeners growing food for\n themselves in a shared space.\n\n Cultivation is quite different from most other games. It is a social\n simulation, and the primary form of conflict is over land and plant\n resources. There is no shooting, but there are plenty of angry looks. It is\n also an evolution simulation. Within the world of Cultivation, you can\n explore a virtually infinite spectrum of different plant and gardener\n varieties.\n interface::x11, role::program, uitoolkit::TODO, use::gameplaying,\n x11::application\n",
