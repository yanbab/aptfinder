 "details":" This is a small, abstract shooting game from Japanese developer Kuni.\n It is a 'caveflier' in which the exhaust from the engine serves also as\n a tool to erode the cave walls.\n\n Your goal is to fly upwards as long as you possibly can, without\n crashing against the cave walls and the window borders.\n uitoolkit::sdl, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
