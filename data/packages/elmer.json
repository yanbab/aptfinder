 "description":"finite element multiphysics suite - binaries",
 "details":" The Elmer multiphysics simulation package includes physical models of\n fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer, and\n acoustics, among others. These are described by partial differential equations\n which Elmer solves by the Finite Element Method (FEM).\n\n Elmer uses METIS (or its free counterpart Scotch) for mesh partitioning, and\n (P)ARPACK, UMFPACK, BLAS\/LAPACK, and hypre to solve the sparse linear systems\n resulting from FEM discretization. It includes pre- and post-processors, and\n several examples illustrating simulation of various physical phenomena.\n\n Elmer's lead institution is CSC in collaboration with Finnish universities,\n research institutes, and industry.\n\n This package provides the Elmer binaries, including the solver (single- and\n multi-processor versions), GUI, and post-processor.\n",
