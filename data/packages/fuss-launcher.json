 "details":" This panel applet provides an application launcher developed by the FUSS\n project, which uses apt-xapian-index to find applications given a few\n keywords.\n\n Since the index also contains Debian package information, keyword search is\n not limited to the application name and short description provided by desktop\n files.\n\n You can also drag a file into Fuss Launcher to see the applications that can\n open it. Fuss Launcher also remembers frequently used applications and allows\n to build a quick-launch list of user favourites.\n",
