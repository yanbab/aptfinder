 "description":"GNOME molecular modelling environment",
 "details":" Ghemical is a computational chemistry software package written in C++.\n It has a graphical user interface and it supports both quantum-\n mechanics (semi-empirical) models and molecular mechanics models.\n Geometry optimization, molecular dynamics and a large set of\n visualization tools using OpenGL are currently available.\n\n Ghemical relies on external code to provide the quantum-mechanical\n calculations. Semi-empirical methods MNDO, MINDO\/3, AM1 and PM3 come\n from the MOPAC7 package (Public Domain), and are included in the\n package. The MPQC package is used to provide ab initio methods: the\n methods based on Hartree-Fock theory are currently supported with\n basis sets ranging from STO-3G to 6-31G**.\n role::program, suite::gnome, uitoolkit::gtk, use::editing,\n use::viewing, works-with::3dmodel, x11::application\n",
