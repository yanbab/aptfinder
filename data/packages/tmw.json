 "description":"The Mana World is a 2D MMORPG",
 "details":" The Mana World (TMW for short) is an innovative, free and open source MMORPG.\n Besides the official game server, this client can connect to multiple\n community-grown servers, which provide varied environments and further\n challenge. In TMW, the players solve quests, fight monsters, practice skills\n and study magic. Social activities include parties, trading and limited PvP in\n designated areas. While there are no limits to solo play, collaborative\n behaviour such as healing others, fighting together and banding up against\n tougher monsters are rewarded in the game. The Mana World graphics have been\n inspired by 2D pixel art at its prime of the late 1990s, when many RPG\n classics, such as Secret of Mana for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System,\n were released.\n",
