Its core feature set includes syntax\n highlighting of source code, auto indentation and printing and print preview\n support.\n\n gedit is also extensible through its plugin system, which currently\n includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS\n ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.\n uitoolkit::gtk, use::editing, works-with::text, works-with::unicode,\n x11::application\n",
