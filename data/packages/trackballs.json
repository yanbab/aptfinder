 "description":"An OpenGL-based game of marbles through a labyrinth",
 "details":" Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness\n on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth\n filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the\n player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues\n at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out.\n\n This game is not intended to be a replica of Marble Madness but rather\n inspired by it. The game is also highly configurable by using a\n scripting extension (Guile) and it provides a simple editor by which new\n levels can easily be created.\n\n Install the trackballs-music package for a soundtrack to be played during\n gameplay. For more information and screenshots of the game please see\n <http:\/\/trackballs.sourceforge.net>.\n uitoolkit::sdl, use::editing, use::gameplaying, x11::application\n",
