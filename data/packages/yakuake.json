 "description":"a Quake-style terminal emulator based on KDE Konsole technology",
 "details":" YaKuake is inspired from the terminal in the Quake game: when you press a key\n (by default F12, but that can be changed) a terminal window slides down from\n the top of the screen. Press the key again, and the terminal slides back.\n\n It is faster than a keyboard shortcut because it is already loaded into memory\n and as such is very useful to anyone who frequently finds themselves switching\n in and out of terminal sessions.\n uitoolkit::qt, x11::application, x11::terminal\n",
