After an\n unfortunate turn of events they find themselves stranded in the heart\n of the Amazon jungle, where Joe will embark on a quest to rescue a\n kidnapped princess and in the process, discover the true sinister\n intentions of a suspiciously located Lederhosen company. In a rich 2D\n environment, Joe will cross paths with a variety of unlikely jungle\n inhabitants including, but not limited to, a tribe of Amazon women and\n 6-foot-tall pygmies.\n\n Note that this package only contains game-data.
