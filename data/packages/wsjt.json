 "details":" WSJT is designed to facilitate Amateur Radio communication under extreme\n weak-signal conditions.  Three very different coding and modulation\n methods are provided: one for communication by \"meteor scatter\"\n techniques on the VHF bands; one for meteor and ionospheric scatter,\n primarily on the 6 meter band; and one for the very challenging\n EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) path.\n",
