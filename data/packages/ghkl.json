 "description":"diffractometer computation control application",
 "details":" The hkl library is a framework for diffraction computation and\n diffractometer control, heavily used at the SOLEIL synchrotron. It\n supports various types of diffractometer geometry: Eulerian 4-circle,\n Eulerian 6-circle, kappa 4-circle, kappa 6-circle, and z-axis\n geometry. For each of these it provides several numerically computed\n modes, such as bisector and constant psi.\n\n This package provides a gui on top of the hkl library.\n science::calculation, science::data-acquisition, uitoolkit::gtk\n",
