 "details":" Tunnel enables you to draw cave surveys based on Survex-compatible\n centreline data. Drawings will be adjusted to fit if the underlying\n data moves due to loop closures. Original drawings\/scans\/pockettopo\n imports can be used as a basis to draw over. Complex multi-layered\n surveys can be drawn, and good use is made of colour to distinguish\n aspects such as levels.\n role::program, use::editing, use::organizing, use::viewing,\n works-with-format::gif, works-with-format::jpg, works-with-format::png,\n works-with-format::svg, works-with-format::xml,\n works-with::image:raster, works-with::image:vector, x11::application\n",
