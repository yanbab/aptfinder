 "description":"Java morphing film-make program for pixel picture-input",
 "details":" Give two human-face pictures as inputs into the program. Then mark\n important locations whithin both faces by pairs of corresponding points.\n The program will create a short enumerated picture series in which the left\n face moves (morphs) into the right one. You can then create a MPEG (see\n mencoder) from the picture series. An animated GIF (see GIMP) is also\n possible.\n",
