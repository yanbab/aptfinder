 "details":" This is a port of the MacBill, which is based on xbill, source to GNUstep.\n\n Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and\n someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people running\n around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM],\n a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  Your\n objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.\n If one of the people reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your\n operating system with the virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off\n the screen with your vital software.\n role::program, suite::gnustep, uitoolkit::gnustep, use::gameplaying,\n x11::applet\n",
