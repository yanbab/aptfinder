 "description":"tool to generate Smith Charts",
 "details":" A Smith chart is a tool used in electrical engineering that\n shows how the complex impedance of a transmission line varies along its\n length, and simplifies the design of impedance matching networks to match\n the line to its load.\n\n linSmith is a Smith Charting program, mainly designed for educational use.\n As such, there is an emphasis on capabilities that improve the 'showing\n the effect of'-style of operation.\n\n It's main features are:\n  * Definition of multiple load impedances (at different frequencies)\n  * Addition of discrete (L, C, parallel and series LC, and transformer)\n    and line components (open and closed stubs, line segments)\n  * Connection in series and parallel\n  * Easy experimentation with values using scrollbars\n  * A 'virtual' component switches from impedance to admittance to help\n    explaining (or understanding) parallel components\n  * The chart works in real impedances (not normalized ones)\n  * Direct view of the result on the screen\n  * Ability to generate publication quality Postscript output\n  * A 'log' file with textual results at each intermediate step\n  * Load and circuit configuration is stored separately, permitting several\n    solutions without re-defining the other\n uitoolkit::gtk\n",
