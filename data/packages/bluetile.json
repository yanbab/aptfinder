 "details":" Bluetile is a tiling window manager designed to integrate with the\n GNOME desktop environment. It provides both a traditional, stacking\n layout mode as well as tiling layouts where windows are arranged to\n use the entire screen without overlapping. Bluetile tries to make the\n tiling paradigm easily accessible to users coming from traditional\n window managers by drawing on known conventions and providing both\n mouse and keyboard access for all features.\n x11::window-manager\n",
